Learn CRUD endpoint calls with React

1. I highly recommend you copy the package.json and webpack.config.js files and put them in a "resource" folder on your desktop. They are setup to be put into any new project
-- We are going to modify the package.json and webpack.config.js files so they are connected to this project's current file structure
2. In your package.json we have the option to edit the name, description, and author keys (It isn't necessary) They are located on lines 2, 4, and 9
-- However the webpack.config.js file changes ARE necessary. This file tells webpack where to output bundle.js and the entry point for webpack.
3. In your webpack.config.js change line 3 to match the location of your reactApp.js file. The file location is based off of webpack.config.js' location. ( './public/app/reactApp.js' )
4. In your webpack.config.js change line 7 to match the location of your scripts folder. The file location is based off of webpack.config.js location. ( './public/script' )
